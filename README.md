# Firefly Trivia

A trivia game based on the TV show *Firefly* (tragically cancelled in its infancy) and the companion movie, *Serenity* (get it, companion? yes, roll your eyes, I know). This app is designed to demonstrate an understanding of intervals and timeouts in javascript. You can check it out [here](https://strangebrewer.github.io/Bootcamp-09-Firefly-Trivia/).
