# Firefly Trivia

A more complex version of the bootcamp assignment using timeouts and intervals.

A trivia game based on the TV show *Firefly* (tragically cancelled in its infancy) and the companion movie, *Serenity* (get it, companion? yes, roll your eyes, I know). You can check it out [here](https://strangebrewer.github.io/Bootcamp-09-Firefly-Trivia/).
